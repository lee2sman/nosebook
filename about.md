# This is the ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““

Hi there, you've reached the ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ (aka NoseBook).

The ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ site is a personal wiki for online research, tutorials, notes and ideas. It is a digital notebook of collected and constructed resources, code snippets, doodles â€“ a personal collection of writing and links not formatted for presentation but instead intended as an *always under construction* knowledge base

It is built in Jekyll on GitHub by [Lee Tusman](http://leetusman.com)
