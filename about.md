## Hello there, you've reached the ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ (NoseBook).

The ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ site is a personal wiki for online research, tutorials, notes and ideas. It is a digital notebook of collected and constructed resources, code snippets, doodles â€“ a personal collection of writing and links not formatted for finished presentation but instead intended as an <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/">always under construction</a> knowledge base.
