I recently [wrote an article](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/pyradio) for Opensource.com, a website that publishes article on open source software and its community. 

In the article I describe PyRadio, a really wonderful and simple way to play internet radio stations or any online audio files. Like many people - especially fellow artists, musicians and programmers - I'm a heavy listener. I really like using PyRadio because it's fast, it's free, it's open source, it doesn't track me or send or share any of my data to a company, and it's customizable. I've always disliked iTunes for example. And although Spotify is fairly easy to use, it's a product. PyRadio in contrast just drops away. I spend almost no time looking at it. My interaction is pretty much limited to booting it up and selecting a station to listen from my list of about 20 stations I listen to. When I get bored or want to try a different station I flip back over, and select another station. It's pretty much similar listening to the radio in the car except that it only has stations and playlistis I want to listen to.

The hardest part of using PyRadio is the barrier of entry. To install, you need to be a Linux command line user. If that's you, check out my [article](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/pyradio) to learn how to get started with PyRadio. If it's not you, you should probably check out any Linux guide, such as my [Working With The Command Line](http://leetusman.com/intermediate-programming/posts/intro-to-command-line/) introduction.

As a command line application PyRadio should work on any computer that is based on BSD or Linux, including Macintosh but also cars, ATMs, raspberry pi computers. I don't have a Android/Linux tablet but I'm thinking I should get one and try it out on that as well.

Here's a screenshot of PyRadio in action:
