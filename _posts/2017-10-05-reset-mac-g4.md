# RESET POWER MAC G4

Here's one method to reset the password without the install disc:

1. boot computer and hold the "apple" key and the "s" key.
2. wait for terminal show
3. release keys
4. type without the quotes: "/sbin/mount -uaw"
5. press enter
6. type without the quotes: "rm /var/db/.applesetupdone
7. press enter
8. type without the quotes: "reboot"
9. press enter

This will let you create a new admin account when you reboot your computer. When you login as the new admin you can simply delete the old one and youâ€™re good to go again!
