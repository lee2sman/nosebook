# Paradigm of Academia/Military inventing the internet vs hobbyist/community-networks
* We discuss military/arpanet-via universities but leave out the hobbyist community from the history
* Community Memory, Usenet, FIDO, ECHO

# Examples of community networks
* [Redhook Wifi](http://redhookwifi.org/)
* [People's Open Network](https://peoplesopen.net/) - mesh network
* [Guifi](http://guifi.net) - mesh network

# Current explorations
* Beaker browser

## distributed Social Media
* Rotonde
* Mastadon

## Distributed web community
* [Tilde](https://tilde.tinyserver.club/~jkriss/writing/the-web) / [Of Many Trades](http://ofmanytrades.com/), etc


# Mozilla NSF

* Challenge 1 - prototype off-the-grid internet - how to provide needed info/etc/apps? (maps? resources. a simple messaging app, etc) during disasters
* Challenge 2 - Smart Community Networks Challenge - how can we leverage existing physical or network infrastructure to provide high-quality wireless connectivity to communities in need
	* how can you be scrappy and build something scalable

### Considerations
* technical feasibility
* differentiation
* affordability
* social impact
* scalability


## 2 stages
* Design Concept Stage
* Working Prototype Stage
