*This tutorial assumes readers have some previous beginner-level experience with HTML and Javascript*.

[Tracery](https://tracery.io/) is a tool to generate text, stories, and even images, *via* text. It's the creation of [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/), who has worked creating generative art and *toys* for many years. Compton created Tracery over a decade ago, and it's long been the tool of choice for bot-makers. When I was first wading deep into creating media artworks and later procedurally-generated projects I was enamored with the scene of artistic bots that lived on Twitter. I created several of my own. 

[V. Buckenham](https://vbuckenham.com/) created the web-based tool [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), which gave a nice web interface to script a bot using Tracery and then to launch it on [Twitter](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). Around the time an evil billionaire purchased that social media product, [these kinds of generative artistic bots](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/the-art-bots-that-make-twitter-worth-looking-at-again/) were prevented from working through an API change, and any folks that remained on this now-irrelevant platform decided to clear out for other less-fashy online spaces. In fact through the *power of open source* the Cheap Bots Done Quick project has been forked and kept alive through [Cheap Bots, Toot Sweet!](https://cheapbotstootsweet.com/) for Mastodon bots and [Blue Bots, Done Quick!](https://bluebotsdonequick.com/) for BlueSky.

But aside from botmaking, Tracery can be used in software, websites and games. I wanted to use it to make a simple custom Lorem Ipsum generator. Lorem ipsum is example text you can use as a designer to see how your text will fit on a web page or in a program or in a page of a book for example, named for the latin text often used. There are many easily searchable Lorem Ipsum text generators. Bacon Ipsum, Hipster ipsum are two that immediately come to mind.

I wanted to make my own bespoke retro and shareware-style software description generator to describe the kinds of things I would have found in a cheap bin at the local computer store in the late 90s (well, maybe not), so [I made one with Tracery](https://leetusman.com/lorem).

## Getting started with Tracery

Tracery is a tool to construct *grammars*. The word grammar here means basic sentence structures. It works very similarly to the classic game of Mad Libs, but instead of just supplying a blank space where you want words filled in, you specify a list of words or even constructions of words to fill in. You create an *origin* that is the recipe for filling in words randomly. The grammar lives in a json data file.

Here's a basic example:

```
{
"greeting":["Hello!","Top of the morning to ya!","The best part of waking up is Folger's in your cup"],
"person":["stranger","sailor","mom"],

"origin": ["#greeting# #person#."]
}
```

Our program will start at the source. First it will pick a random word from greeting, followed by a randomly selected person word.

If you want to try this code out in the online [Tracery Editor](https://tracery.io/editor/) you can remove the original code and paste into the editor. Press *reroll* to see different results.

Tracery also allows us to create more complex grammars, and comes with some nice tooling. You can capitalize a word by adding `.capitalize` for example. These are called *modifiers*. Some other modifiers capitalize all expansion words, add s to pluralize a word, or change present to past tense ("ed").

```
"origin": ["#greeting# #person.capitalize#."]
```

Often you may want to expand text strings to use further text strings. Here's an example of that:

```
{
"greeting":["Hello!","Top of the morning to ya!","The best part of waking up is Folger's in your cup,"],
"person":["stranger","sailor","mom"],
"occurrence":["talking to a #person#"],

"origin": ["#greeting# #person.capitalize#. I couldn't help but notice you #occurrence#."]
}
```

Which produces results like:

> Top of the morning to ya! Mom. I couldn't help but notice you talking to a sailor.

There are more things that Tracery can do. I recommend you check out the [project repo](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/tree/tracery2) to review it.

## Integrating Tracery with a website

If you're not making a bot and want to produce procedurally-generated text on a website, here's how you can do it.

Create your basic webpage. At the very least, you'll need to link to Tracery, to your own script, and (unfortunately) Tracery currently requires jquery as a dependency.

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <title>My Tracery project</title>
 
   <!-- this is a link to the jquery slim minified library for testing. I personally usually self-host if I publish the project online -->
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha256-kmHvs0B+OpCW5GVHUNjv9rOmY0IvSIRcf7zGUDTDQM8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
 
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Tracery project</h1>
  <div id="myTracery"></div>
  
   <noscript>This generative text project requires JavaScript.</noscript> 
   
   <script src="js/tracery.js"></script>
   <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

We've made a minimal starter website, linked to the jQuery CDN (or self-host), linked to a downloaded version of Tracery in a folder *js*, and linked to our own custom *main.js* script also in the js folder.

## Hooking up Tracery to our site

We create a *js* directory in our root folder for our website and download [tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/blob/tracery2/js/tracery/tracery.js) into that directory.

Lastly, create a new text file, which we'll call `main.js` and place in the *js* directory.

Here's some starter code for `main.js`, which will hook into our div with the id #myTracery in our html file:

```js
ourText = {
"greeting":["Hello!","Top of the morning to ya!","The best part of waking up is Folger's in your cup,"],
"person":["stranger","sailor","mom"],
"occurrence":["talking to a #person#"],
"origin": ["#greeting# #person.capitalize#. I couldn't help but notice you #occurrence#."]
}

//starts up Tracery
let grammar = tracery.createGrammar(ourText);
//saves output as a string
let s = grammar.flatten("#origin#");

//places that string in our div on the html page
document.getElementById("myTracery").textContent=s;
```

And that's the most basic version of using Tracery.

You can see a simple example in my custom [Lorem Ipsum Software page](https://leetusman.com/lorem/). Feel free to [view source](view-source:https://leetusman.com/lorem/) on it.
