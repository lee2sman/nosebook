# Terrible Interfaces

I liked [this](http://cogdogblog.com/2015/05/personal-toolkit-for-information/) article by Alan Levine about a *personal toolkit for information*. He describes the original raison d'etre of Hypercard and it's lovely ability to be both software itself as well as a GUI/user-friendly tool for making other tools. He (and I) also love that you can program in text or using a user-friendly graphical interface. This for me is the holy grail. I'm still working toward it!

In general, I want a more casual web, where things can be sloppy, handmade, DIY. I don't want to say too much about this right now. I just want to do it.
