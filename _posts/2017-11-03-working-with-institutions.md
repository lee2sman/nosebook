# Artists/arts orgs - How to Work with Institutions

# Take your own Documentation!

* Mark Allen spends 20% of budget on documentation!
* institutions won't necessarily care about same design/aesthetic/shots/etc
* Design and make your own documentation
* you never want to be in a position where you have to ask the institution for access to the documentation!

# General Notes

* how will your work be communicated to the world?
* don't just accept cultural capital. how will you be paid?
* find scale of budget first. is this $500 or $5000? - for example. Is budget flexible?
* if you have an org, make sure your org gets at least 20% toward your admin
* might be a boss that likes you but their employees might not
* key is be friendly with everyone, meet them, and build those relationships
* make sure people get compensation (money, food, whatever it is)
* these companies/orgs sometimes have a hierarchy of who should get paid, etc. if the institution is not looking out for it, you should advocate for your artists, partners, etc
* you have a power at the beginning of the relationship particularly to advocate for more equitable relationships
* be creative in reaching audience - what is needed? door-to-door? radio? etc
* project doesn't work for you? bail! :)

# Contracts

* these institutions have legal team - so review contract and make sure to read it and maybe even write your own!
* review the boilerplate legal contracts
* ask for what you want!
* Book: Heather Bin Darcy Bendari's book - ART WORK - has info on writing and reviewing contracts
* take your time to review the contract
* Alternatively, even create a Memo of Understanding, such as in an email
* "Hey, great meeting today. Just to follow up, here's what we talked about to do. ......."
* If your deliverables change in course, you may want to revise contract with the institution! and that's okay
* other idea: what are the things i care about? call those things 'my artwork' and include them in the work, potentially even in the display.

# Identify what everyone brings to the partnership
* what does the institution want out of this?
* bringing audience? specific press?
* what are the unconscious expectations? let's get them out on the table
* Be transparent! if you can
* *cynically* you should consider what an org is trying to get out of the partnership - should you do the project? think about their goals. what would they be getting out of this relationship.
