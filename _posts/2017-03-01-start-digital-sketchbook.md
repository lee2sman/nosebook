# Start

I am starting this wiki right here. I am starting with an idea. 1. that hyperlinks/hypertext and hyper-anything are pleasurable post-paper ideals 2. that hyperbook is a pretty chill name 3. Auriea Harvey talks about Make Wikis Not Blogs (She didn't say those words but I'm paraphrasing). She's talking about a Wiki as a [form of self-portraiture](http://auriea.org/index.pl/WhatIsAWiki).

> A wiki is a system for making web pages. It writes most of the code for you so that you can concentrate on the content, on the form of each page. so each page of a wiki is a container. the other data surrounding it is persisent (the HTML/TITLE/BODY/CSS tags, any optional sidebars or whatever) But the page of a wiki can theoretically contain ANYTHING.  it is an empty book. a blank canvas.  but it is also endless. I would like to view the wiki as a little box i whisper into. people can look at it, but not directly. like a total eclipse.

> I keep wanting to go back to using analog Sketchbooks... i miss it dearly being scrawl based rathar than text based. i hate being text based. but what the wiki allows is the ability to learn from [history](http://auriea.org/index.pl/history). things are never folded away forever but can become part of a larger continuum of thoughts, ideas, images. The keyboard is jut not an ideal input for this. I wonder if having a Tablet PC would augment this activity in a good way?

Ok, but why am I lee making a wiki? I think I tooo am trying to use this a sort of space to jot down notes, organize, but also build tools, write, organize, mess, etc. I looked into many wiki softwares/systems. My requirements were ability to write on any computer and phone. Commandline but also web interface. Ability to style/css. Include images. And be loose-messy.

I checked out Gollum, TiddlyWiki, and a million more. Then I though about good old HTML, and markdown, and could it live in a git repo? Maybe! I'm going to try it.

This isn't a wiki for anyone else. It's for me. I may share it with people I care about. It will live online so it can be referenced anywhere. It will adapt and change.

Other names: Wiki Wild Wild, Hyperfoot, Hyperduck, Casual.wiki
