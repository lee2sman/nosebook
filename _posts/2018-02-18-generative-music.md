### Generative Art, Music and Writing

A non-comprehensive but broad overview  of generative art (and music and writing) systems. Generative art is work created based on the use of systems to generate part of or complete works of art. These systems take on the role of creator or otherwise independently produce works without direct supervision of an artist-creator. Many systems rely on chance operations or data as input that directs or influence the creation of the work so that each iteration or runthrough of the system may generate a new and unique work.
