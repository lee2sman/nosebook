1. No one is going to look at your website so code it for you.
2. Moving gifs are better than jpegs. 
2. All photos are manipulated. Nothing is stock. Everything is stolen. 
3. Comic Sans is fine. The bigger the font the better.

4. Ugly is beautiful.
5. Easy to navigate is uneccessary. We are not selling anything. A website should unfold like a chess game, attic or squat.
6. Sites should be coded in 4 hours or less or 2 hours is even better. After midnight is preferred. They are not coded "with love" - They are coded with carpal tunnel syndrome and energy drinks in bed at 3am.
7. Unneccessary music, fonts, web banners, ads and anything else are encouraged.
8. Don't overthink. Finish before you are done. Publish.
