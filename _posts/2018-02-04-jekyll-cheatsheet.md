## Using a post template

In the *front matter* you can set what template to use with ```layout: template-name```. There needs to be a corresponding template with that name in the ```_layouts``` folder.

## Making a direct URL for a post

Instead of the default posted /year/month/day/title.html you can add a line to the frontmatter to get a direct URL link.

```
permalink: title.html
```

## Where to create Pages (not Posts)

For example, this wiki has an *about.html* which is a page, not a ~~post!~~.

**Very simple!**

2 options:

1. Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your siteâ€™s root folder.
2. Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want

When Jekyll runs it will place the page in the root of the _site folder or in a subfolder depending on whether you've placed into a subfolder or not. The permalinks will mirror the subfolder structure.

## Internal links to other posts

[Simple!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4629675/jekyll-markdown-internal-links#9195560)

* useful in case I change my domain/permalinks
