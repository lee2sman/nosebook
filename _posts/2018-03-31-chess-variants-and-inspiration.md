The month of April is [Chess Jam](https://itch.io/jam/chess-jam), an indie game jam organized by game maker [Sophie Houlden](https://sophieh.itch.io/). The rules for the jam are simple, to make a game or work inspired by the game of Chess. Chess is believed to have been invented in the 6th century in India and spread worldwide over several centuries. The present standard chess piece configuration and rules for moving are believed to have been developed in 15th century Spain, standardizied in the 1800s.

I am a huge fan of chess and have read a number of strategy books but I realized I didn't want to dedicate so much time to perfecting my game. My joy lay in the beauty of the gameplay. I took a step back and started getting more absorbed by chess variants and games inspired by chess. This coincided with a course at UCLA on board game design. I built a chess variant called Chezz++, influenced by the game [Bosworth](https://www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=011765/~affil=EYEG) a 4-player chess variant by Funagain games, as well as [Knightmare Chess](http://www.sjgames.com/knightmare/), a deckbuilding game that uses a pack of cards to alter pieces or the rules of a game almost like a combination of Chess and Magic The Gathering.

In this time I researched chess variants old and new. Also at UCLA I co-curated the Game Arts Festival at The Hammer Museum in 2015, a festival that included performances, board games, videogames and machinema. One of the projects we featured was Nova Jiang's [Orthogonal Diagonal](http://www.novajiang.com/projects/orthogonaldiagonal/), which presents 8 different chess variants from around the world with special 3d printed pieces and lasercut boards that indicate how to use the pieces through their design. 

In addition to the long history of Chess as an analog board game there is an exciting history of computer chess. The initial idea of a chess-playing automaton can be traced to the 1770s with the Mechanical Turk, a hoax that actually concealed a tiny chess grandmaster inside its cabinet. In my 2016 work [Literal Mechanical Turk](http://leetusman.com/projects/literal_mechanical_turk.html) I created a modern version of the hoax. I posted tasks to Amazon's [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/), submitting chess moves in Algebraic Notation, as if I was testing a computer chess program, though I asked Turkers to film themselves making response moves (note: I paid significantly higher than most tasks posted to Mechanical Turk). Together, we played a complete game of chess, with my own role as player concealed. I won the game.

In the first half of the 20th century a number of ideas for chess-playing algorithms were proposed, and the first prototype machine to play a simplified game was created by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo in 1912. None other than Alan Turing was the first to propose a full system for a chess-playing program capable of playing a full game. Martin Gardner's article on *Mathematical Games* appeared in Scientific American in 1962. In it he describes [Hexapawn](http://www.chessvariants.com/small.dir/hexapawn.html), a chess-like game played with black and white pawns on a 3x3 grid board. He talks about how computers may one day be taught to play chess, and a simplified system for building your own analog machine intelligence to create a program that teaches itself to improve its game. I read this article as a child in the 80s and it was deeply influential to me. I built my own version of Hexapawn as described in the article using matchbooks to store the logic. Later I came across a BASIC Hexapawn [program](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=83) in the 1978 BASIC Computer Games book. It is a [classic](https://www.bowdoin.edu/~sbarker/teaching/courses/fall17/ds/files/lab6.pdf) university computer science assignment to build your own Hexapawn program from scratch, often in C, C++ or Java.

So many people find inspiration in Chess, which I think comes down to the beauty, simplicity and idiosyncracies of the game. You can start quite small, learning the rules, but there is always more to perfect. The term *chess variant* was defined by David Pritchard in his book [The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants](http://www.chessvariants.com/books.dir/ecv.html) simply as "related to, derived from, or inspired by chess." The book was published in 1994 and contains 1400 variations on the traditional chess game. Chess variants tend to expand on the rules primarily through creating new chess pieces, known as [Fairy pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece), expanding the number of players, changing something about the board, or changing the *win* objective from Checkmating the opponent's king to another win-state.

With so many variants it can be hard to know which direction to turn to find a game that excites you, or in the case of the chess jam, to know which direction one should explore when creating their own chess-inspired game. Below I have compiled a number of interesting chess variants or games inspired by chess including board and video games. Rather than an attempt at breadth, this is a more selective list of games that I think are particularly unique or exciting. In general, areas relating to storytelling or newt conceptual approaches, perhaps married to creating new pieces feel underexplored in the world of chess variants and chess-inspired games. I haven't been able to find it, but I had an Usborne chess book as a child that included a playable story of an adventurer that squares off with a number of enemies and chess challenges, an approach that I think could be rather exciting. 

Below, I list some of my favorite chess variants and inspirations. In addition I highly recommend reading the [List Of Chess Variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants) Wikipedia page, which lists an incredible number of variants broken down into various categories. In fact, I was surprised to find that there are [1-dimensional](http://www.chessvariants.com/shape.dir/onedim.html) chess variants, an area that seems worth exploring further (I am also thinking about the 1-dimensional roguelike/dungeon-crawler games [Line Wobbler](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-10-introducing-line-wobbler-a-one-dimensional-dungeon-crawler) and [Cosmic Crown](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cosmic-crown/id927062815?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4), 2 games that are simple but compelling.

And without further ado, the games...

# Play It By Trust

[Play It By Trust](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yokoonoofficial/2892798380/) aka White Chess Set (1966) by Yoko Ono  

> "Many artists have worked with chess, but they usually worked with the decorative aspect of the chess pieces. I wanted to create a new chess game, making a fundamental rather than decorative change. The white chess set is a sort of life situation. Life is not all black and white, you don't know what is yours and what is theirs. You have to convince people what is yours. In the chess situation it is simple if you are black then black is yours. But this is like a life situation, where you have to play it by convincing each other."

Interestingly, Ono also created the iOS chess game [Yoko Chess](https://mashable.com/2015/06/29/yoko-chess-ios) in 2015, which includes a *normal* version of chess playable with dog pieces, as well as Play it by Trust. Sadly, it appears this app has disappeared from the app store.

# Orthogonal Diagonal 

[Orthogonal Diagonal](http://www.novajiang.com/projects/orthogonaldiagonal/) by Nova Jiang.

8 international versions of Chess, with pieces and board designed to make gameplay easy to learn. This isn't a variation or variant of chess so much as a meta presentation and design to present variants.

# Knightmare Chess

[Knightmare Chess](http://www.sjgames.com/knightmare/) published by Steve Jackson Games, or its older french cousin Tempête sur l'échiquier (Storm on the Chessboard), designed by Pierre Cléquin and Bruno Faidutti. In Knightmare Chess the players build decks, draw and play cards that change the default rules of chess. Cards affect individual pieces on the board, change game objectives, create special spaces on the board, or have other effects on the game. In my experience Chess purists hate this variation as each turn dramatically changes the meta-rules of the game, making any longterm strategy relatively useless.

# Bosworth

[Bosworth](https://www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=011765/~affil=EYEG) is a 2-4 player chess variant played on a smaller 6x6 grid, along with playing cards. There is no checkmate in the game. Players attempt to capture all enemies' kings to win. Each player has a deck of cards listing all of their pieces. They must play a card in order to cast one of their pieces on the game board.

# Chesh

[Chesh](http://www.chesh.club/) is an iOS game by Damion Sommer. It presents a *randomly-generated board game for two* played between 2 human players or a single player versus the computer. Unlike Chess, which rewards digging in deep and mastering the moves of the game, Chesh is designed to be unpredictable. Each game the pieces' moves are randomly generated. You find out how they can move when you select a piece and its possible placement is revealed. In this way, learning the opening moves of the game is impossible. There is  no checkmating in the game. You win by taking a certain value of your opponent's pieces. Interestingly, I discovered an earlier version of Chesh called XYQ4 posted online [here](https://damiansommer.itch.io/xyq4), linked from [this](https://killscreen.com/articles/how-to-make-1500-year-old-game-interesting-again/) article in KillScreen (RIP).
