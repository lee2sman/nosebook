A running stream of links and ideas from a conversation in September 2016 that started at the offices of [Universal Research Group](http://www.universalresearch.group/) in Chinatown and continued at Chin's Push (RIP) in Highland Park, Los Angeles.

* [Glitch.com](http://glitch.com) - what happens when they attempt to monetize it?
* We made [this](https://peridot-restaurant.glitch.me/) in about 10 seconds
* The [alpha editor](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org) for p5js

* OLPC XO - rugged tablet! back to computer - plug in hardware?
* Kano computer - modular, monitor, pi - plug in hardware!

## Collaborative live painting - RDP w/ JAS
* Creating like a standalone hardware for digital painting. maybe with raspberry pi
* hooked into/packaged with midi fighter controller
* examples: Etch-A-Sketch-wired, Ming Micro, using CHIPv2, Rasp Pi,
* like a game
* top down view
* weapons are the tools/brushes
* like [Robotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOVA2Axxfdk)
* think of a MacPaint-like interface but your character has to walk over to the tool, step on it, and then walk back onto the canvas
*

* Doorway to another level - Every character has to walk over to it to trigger / swipe to next screen-canvas?
* Different modes? Adventure mode, timer countdown mode...
* C or JS? :)
