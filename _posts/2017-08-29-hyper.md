# Hyper

Hyperbook as de-centered text.
The electronic labryinth.
infinite hypertext
borges - the library in babel

[Available hypertext authoring systems](http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0140.html) - current as of 1993!
* Hyperpad - [This](http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0138.html) article claims it is a HyperCard clone for DOS, that it's *minimal* AND that it comes with a **830 page** manual! Yoooinks!
* [HyperShell](http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0135.html) sounds very much like how I'm currently writing this wiki. With text in a terminal. actually minimal.
* HyperTies
* HyperWriter!
* [Hypercard](http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0154.html)

Hyperbole.
