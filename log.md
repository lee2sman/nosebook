# Log

*This is a page for ongoing tiny updates on my projects and research.*

## 2024-01-08

Added a page on Lua to my [Programming Notes](https://leetusman.com/notes/programming/) page. I also started working on building a basic theme template system for the note pages.

I continued work on my Forth-like language.

I'm kicking off this tinylog today. I'm not 100% sure I'll stick with it, but I enjoyed participating in the [December Adventure](https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2024/) last month and thought I should have a spot to plop down further thoughts as I build projects or do research or what-have-you. I think anything that isn't quite a blog post or a project page could go here.

The past couple days I've been reviewing NTTP's tutorial [More About Tiny Scripting Languages](https://notimetoplay.org/engines/more-scripting.html) and trying to wade into continuing work on my 3th (Forth language). I am having trouble implementing nesting and delimiters.

I went back into the ExquisiteCorp site I prototyped for my music website, but I'm still not sure what domain to register for it and whether the graphics I mocked up really fit with the kind of music I'm making.

Hmmm. Not sure that works. In any case, I've been recording music lately and need a place to plop it!
