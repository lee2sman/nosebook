*This is a page for ongoing tiny updates on my projects and research.*

I'm back in NYC. The past few days I did some course prep for my course Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code. I'm excited for the class. On my laptop I installed [Moby](https://www.moby-thesaurus.org/) open source thesaurus and created a simple command line function alias.

Yesterday Yuehao and I visited MOLAA the Museum of Latin American Art and saw [ARTEÃ”NICA: Art, Science, and Technology in Latin America Today](https://molaa.org/2024-arteonica), which I had been recommended to see by Katherine Moriwaki and Jonah Brucker-Cohen only last week. I'm so thankful for the recommendation as this was an incredible survey exhibition of work from decades past to today. This is a well-curated exhibition, directed by Gabriala Urtiaga. I loved many of the works and took lots of photos and notes. I'm going to include teaching about these artists in my Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code course next semester.

I spent time researching a number of the artists from th eshow. [Francesco Mariotti](https://www.mariotti.ch/en) has a great website documenting his portfolio of works over the years since 1964! I downloaded photos and a PDF from his website on [Chullachaqui](https://www.mariotti.ch/en/bibliography/1984/chullachaqui-5/) Intelligencia Artifical, a series of "AI" projects influenced by Tristan Tzara's dada experiments to modern software arts. He worked with programmers who wrote software in BASIC on the Commodore64 to produce audio and text animals for performances and interactive installations over many years. There was an interview in the PDF and [I used Google Translate to translate to English](https://archive.org/details/inteligencia-artificial-chullachaqui). 

I am still in LA. Two flights on two separate days already cancelled on me! Hoping I can fly home tonight.

Studio visit with Yuehao Jiang and Matt Doyle. We showed each other our recent projects. Yuehao gave some great feedback on my interview art piece currently titled *Hyphenated*. One suggestion was to simplify the background to make the speakers the focus, and to add subtitles. I tried out a 'basic primitives' version and a wilder one in my typical style. Still need to add the subtitles and some other improvements when I'm back in NYC.

Added a page on Lua to my [Programming Notes](https://leetusman.com/notes/programming/) page. I also started working on building a basic theme template system for the note pages.

I continued work on my Forth-like language.

I'm kicking off this tinylog today. I'm not 100% sure I'll stick with it, but I enjoyed participating in the [December Adventure](https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2024/) last month and thought I should have a spot to plop down further thoughts as I build projects or do research or what-have-you. I think anything that isn't quite a blog post or a project page could go here.

The past couple days I've been reviewing NTTP's tutorial [More About Tiny Scripting Languages](https://notimetoplay.org/engines/more-scripting.html) and trying to wade into continuing work on my 3th (Forth language). I am having trouble implementing nesting and delimiters.

I went back into the ExquisiteCorp site I prototyped for my music website, but I'm still not sure what domain to register for it and whether the graphics I mocked up really fit with the kind of music I'm making.

Hmmm. Not sure that works. In any case, I've been recording music lately and need a place to plop it!
