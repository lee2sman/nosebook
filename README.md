# Nosebook

### Hello there, you've reached the ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ (NoseBook).

[LINK TO ARTICLES](http//lee2sman.github.io/nosebook)

The ðŸ‘ƒðŸ““ site is a ~~personal wiki for online research, tutorials, notes and ideas~~  was originally designed as a digital notebook of collected and constructed resources, code snippets, doodles â€“ a personal collection of writing and links not formatted for finished presentation but instead intended as an <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/">always under construction</a> knowledge base. BUT I chickened out and over time decided to write more of a blog instead.
 
I ended up making a wiki as well, but I keep it private on my own machine. It's my own personal digital notebook. THIS right here is for sharing posts.
