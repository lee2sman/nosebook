This is a stub post to bookmark a very simple idea: The basic idea is to build simple webpages as 'app launchers'. Build a simple prototype/framework. Make it easy to change color/page background, font. At the beginning it can be even simpler.

### Examples
* ambient playlists launcher
* P5js resources/launcher
* a 2008-era 'startpage'

I'm thinking about how Increpare is very good at taking ideas like this and turning them into simple useable tools! Like flickgame
